\section{Defenses}
\label{sec:defenses}

There are a few rules /precautionary measures which can be followed by the resource providers such that they do not give way to such vulnerable implementations. These defenses are :

\begin{itemize}
\item Put a hard check on redirect URI mismatch 
\item The only safe validation method for redirect URI is exact matching
\item Do not allow direct request to access token
\item Include a login CSRF token check in the request 
\item Include some uniquely generated value in the request which prevents request forgery
\item Include a two-step verification mechanism
\end{itemize}
