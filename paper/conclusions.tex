\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In conclusion, we have performed a first large scale study on 22 OAuth 2.0 providers and analyed the security holes prevalent in them. We have developed three attacks viz. Login CSRF, redirect mismatch, and cover redirect to attack the providers in the wild and found that 32 percent providers are vulnerable to redirect URI mismatch, 45 percent to cover redirect, and 32 percent to login CSRF. Overall, 73 percent of the providers are vulnerable to the one or the other attacks. Our work gives solid evidence of the provider's behavior with respect to various attacks. We believe that this work is one of its kind and it can be further extended to develop concrete mitigation policies by the OAuth providers.
