The previous work in the field of SSO vulnerabilities comprises of studies which have exposed the weaknesses in the SSO system but has not covered any experiments on the existing providers.\cite{bala:login-csrf} They have only explored the flaws and suggested mechanisms to mitigate the same.\cite{barth:robust-defenses} Also, the previous researchers have suggested the techniques to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Hence, most of the work is theoretical and doesn't focus on the real-time attacks. Inspiring from this fact, we have done a first large study of the OAuth 2.0 providers.
